Hey Ollie!

Looks like the M5 Stack Core 2 is about to arrive at your place if it hasn't already.

My idea is to work with you to get the board set up, then to start programming.

The idea will be to give you several small assignments.  Something like one per day then if we get through 5 or so (i.e. one week's worth) I'll send you $$$.  If we can do one a day until Friday, I'll send $$$ on Friday.

Each assignment will be a programming task initially, because I want to make sure you've got a feeling for variables, if-statements, for-loops, functions, objects, etc.

Then we can start to bring in some electronics / mechanical stuff.  The reason that I wanted to start with the Core2 is that it's self contained and possible to build into other stuff.  We can bring in the SK2 when we want to do some G-Code / stepper stuff.

So here's task one!  Get the basics working.

I don't have my Core2 yet (Monday?) so I can't say for sure what you'll find.  Please TXT me if you get stuck for more than a few minutes.

OK!  GO!
